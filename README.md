# Burn Down Chart

There are a list of improvements which could be applied:
1. Implement jwt token authentication to authorize an user
2. Take into account "weekends"
3. Integrate it with slackbot which will post the chart each morning before daily standup
4. Introduce multiple crawlers to grab statistics for every release from PT hourly.
